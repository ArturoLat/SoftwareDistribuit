# Software Distribuit Repository

This repository contains the practical assignments for a course on distributed software systems, with a focus on interactive games and software testing and deployment.

## [Practica 1: DAN DAN DISH](https://github.com/ArturoLat/SoftwareDistribuit/tree/main/Practica1)

Practica 1 involves a distributed adaptation of the game "DAN DAN DISH", a variation of "Rock, Paper, Scissors" that includes three actions: Reload, Block, and Shoot. This practice explores implementing the synchronous and face-to-face nature of the game in a digital environment.

## [Practica 2: Software Testing and Deployment](https://github.com/ArturoLat/SoftwareDistribuit/tree/main/Practica2)

Practica 2 delves into software testing and deployment, where issues such as transactions with negative balances and ticket purchases without an active session were identified and addressed. The practice covers the use of Docker for containerization and includes detailed explanations of the code and modifications for reevaluation..
